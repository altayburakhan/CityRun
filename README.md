# CityRun
***My game that I developed with Unity Junior Game development course***
- This is a simple Run game however, the background of the character changes as the game progresses.
- I did this project in about 3 hours.
- I have only made 3 levels yet, these levels were made so that the player can know the game and understand the mechanics.
### Level 1
